# [Project 2: Market Research on Ebay Products](https://github.com/kelmensonj/UPC-s-and-the-Ebay-API-for-a-Million-Dollar-Heist)
* Integrates Ebay Shopping and Finding API's with Beautiful Soup and the Requests library in order to get supplemental data
* Collects URL's, Prices, Listing Titles, Conditions, Sellers, Seller Feedback, Seller Usernames using the Ebay API's
* Ebay API's block access to UPC's and EAN's (universal product codes), this python script uses a threadpool executor in order to make over a million URL requests per week, and scrapes URL for UPC's and EAN's
* All information is autosaved to a csv file at a variable interval. The database is built using pandas and will update whatever information is found. 
* You can update the database by querying keywords, UPC codes, sellers, etc. Anything you might type in within the Ebay.com search function can be queried.
* Built a database of well over 40,000 unique UPC codes each with data on at least 3 different listings. Successfully identified multiple underpriced Ebay listings using this information - the listings were bought and flipped for profit. 

# [Project 3: MLB Statistics, a Better Stat than Exit Velocity](https://github.com/kelmensonj/Pybaseball-Pandas-and-Python-for-DIY-Sabermetrics/blob/master/pybaseballPandasPython)

# [Project 4: The Largest Publicly Available Study on SBMM in Videogames to Date](https://github.com/kelmensonj/COD-Warzone-SBMM-study-using-Python-BS4-Selenium-Pandas)
* Utilized Python, Beautiful Soup, Requests, Pandas, Selenium, and Multiprocessing in order to quickly and efficiently web scrape data on millions of players in the popular online Battle Royale COD Warzone
* Inspired by a similar study performed by the youtuber Xclusive Ace, where data on just a few matches and players was collected, this study collected data on over 7,000 matches and hundreds of thousands of players. 
* Used requests and multiprocessing in order to scrape html as quickly as possible. 
* A lot of the data was served using AJAX, so I used Selenium in order to scrape the data only available after Javascript rendered. 
* Used an autosaving database. You could pause and restart whenever you want. 
* (major update on the way, included my first GUI)

# [Project 5: My Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC01Ew2iYxMxFOytlZQqhOEg)
* Various product pitches and ideas
* Various shorts - animations usually around a minute in length that I made using Python scripting and Blender 3D
* Data and audio visualization videos

# [Project 6: Automating Automation](https://github.com/kelmensonj/Computer-Recording-and-Activity-Playback)
* The project I'm most proud of, coming soon.
* I'll be adding more, but in the gif below, you'll see me the cursor moving around and clicking the mouse and pressing keys. This all happens without me pressing anything other than that 'Replay' button at the beginning. The sequence of key presses and mouse movements was recorded and replayed using this project
