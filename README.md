# **Skills**

## **Software**
* Blender 3D: animation, modelling, physics simulation (forcefield, wind, fluid, smoke, fire, rigid and soft body, collision, cloth), video editing, lighting, storytelling, comedy, architectural rendering

* Python: data science, pandas, web scraping, beautiful soup, selenium, pyautogui, multiprocessing, gui, blender scripting, numpy, Ebay API

* Databases: almost all my coding projects incorporate an auto saving database with automatic updating and can handle any missing data

* GUI: I'm not extremely proficient with GUI's. I typically use tkinter but I can also use kivy

* Filing: Most of my coding projects automatically save files and create backups, typically by reading and writing to csv files. Several of my projects parse the current directory and select relevant files to be displayed for selection in the GUI. 

* Automation: I have experience with automatic data aggregation, web scraping, animation rendering, 3D modelling, task queing, data collection, generalized task automation, and more

## **Invention**
* Software: I can rapidly prototype almost any piece of software I think of. I utilize open source software and access API's when applicable, I am completely self taught, and I learn what is neccessary to complete working prototypes of the ideas I have. 
* 3D Modeling: I am highly proficient in the open source CAD software Blender3D. I create highly detailed, textured, and animated models. I often utilize Python scripting in order to create complex 3D animations and models.

## **Writing**
* Comedy, storytelling, dialogue, poetry, persuasive essays

# **Experience**

## **McDonalds Restaurant Worker**
* Entry level, taking orders, serving fries, serving customers
* Drive through, front counter
* Cleaning
* Fries

## **Pizza Place and Trattoria II (Still Restaurant Worker)**
* Running cash register
* Restocking front counter and back room, tables, drinks, and pizza boxes
* Receiving customer orders over phone and in the restaurant
* Dining service and bussing
* Occasionally preparing food
* Occasionally picking up supplies and food from suppliers
* Dishes, cleaning
* Everything besides making the delicious food and coordinating/managing/building/running a thriving local restaurant with thousands of happy customers

# [Project 1: Early Universe Physics Simulation](https://github.com/kelmensonj/Newtownian-Physics-Engine)
* Coded in python, animated in blender
* Accurately simulates gravity acting on a variable number of neutrons
* Scripted and animated as a 3D rendering in Blender

# [Project 2: Market Research on Ebay Products](https://github.com/kelmensonj/UPC-s-and-the-Ebay-API-for-a-Million-Dollar-Heist)
* Integrates Ebay Shopping and Finding API's with Beautiful Soup and the Requests library in order to get supplemental data
* Collects URL's, Prices, Listing Titles, Conditions, Sellers, Seller Feedback, Seller Usernames using the Ebay API's
* Ebay API's block access to UPC's and EAN's (universal product codes), this python script uses a threadpool executor in order to make over a million URL requests per week, and scrapes URL for UPC's and EAN's
* All information is autosaved to a csv file at a variable interval. The database is built using pandas and will update whatever information is found. 
* You can update the database by querying keywords, UPC codes, sellers, etc. Anything you might type in within the Ebay.com search function can be queried.
* Built a database of well over 40,000 unique UPC codes each with data on at least 3 different listings. Successfully identified multiple underpriced Ebay listings using this information - the listings were bought and flipped for profit. 

# [Project 3: MLB Statistics, a Better Stat than Exit Velocity](https://github.com/kelmensonj/Pybaseball-Pandas-and-Python-for-DIY-Sabermetrics/blob/master/pybaseballPandasPython)
* Using pybaseball, pandas, and python, web scraped all publicly available statcast data for variable years and months and assembled all the data in a database
* Added additional data, player names, to the database which only featured unique player id's
* Cleaned and reshaped the data in order to produce park factors and indications of raw power that correlate year to year better than conventional methods 

# [Project 4: The Largest Publicly Available Study on SBMM in Videogames to Date](https://github.com/kelmensonj/COD-Warzone-SBMM-study-using-Python-BS4-Selenium-Pandas)
* Utilized Python, Beautiful Soup, Requests, Pandas, Selenium, and Multiprocessing in order to quickly and efficiently web scrape data on millions of players in the popular online Battle Royale COD Warzone
* Inspired by a similar study performed by the youtuber Xclusive Ace, where data on just a few matches and players was collected, this study collected data on over 7,000 matches and hundreds of thousands of players. 
* Used requests and multiprocessing in order to scrape html as quickly as possible. 
* A lot of the data was served using AJAX, so I used Selenium in order to scrape the data only available after Javascript rendered. 
* Used an autosaving database. You could pause and restart whenever you want. 
* (major update on the way, included my first GUI)

# [Project 5: My Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC01Ew2iYxMxFOytlZQqhOEg)
* Various product pitches and ideas
* Various shorts - animations usually around a minute in length that I made using Python scripting and Blender 3D
* Data and audio visualization videos

# [Project 6: Automating Automation]
* The project I'm most proud of, coming soon.
* I'll be adding more, but in the gif below, you'll see me the cursor moving around and clicking the mouse and pressing keys. This all happens without me pressing anything other than that 'Replay' button at the beginning. The sequence of key presses and mouse movements was recorded and replayed using this project
