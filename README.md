Below are a few projects I'd like to showcase. I suggest 'Automating Automation' for a solid demo that should run on any machine, but also check out 'Data Driven Grow Media for Hydroponics'.

## About Me

I like to say I have a messiah complex. Since going bald at 18 years old and subsequently deep diving into the Technological Singularity, I've always sort of thought I could have a chance to transcend... or at least, that this era in history could matter.  

I have extreme ideas. I won't pursue a project or idea just because it's different, but sometimes it feels that way. I work hard on my own ideas, but I work a lot harder for bosses I respect and ideas I believe in. There's nothing I'm more hungry for than to contribute. It's why I love to play pickup basketball and cook a big meal. It's also why with my web scraping projects for sabermetrics, Ebay, and Skill Based Matchmaking, I'm able to churn out hundreds of lines of code and dozens of animations. These aren't projects I came up with all alone.

I enjoy working in the food industry for a few reasons - but the main reason I have a smile when I'm on the job is because I always seem to have incredible bosses and coworkers. In my life I truly believe I've had zero bad bosses and probably 3 or 4 really great ones. I've been lucky to be a part of great teams - and that extends to my family and the friends I've lucked into. I grew up in Brewster, NY, a scenic suburb of New York City, and without my relatively utopian life experiences to date I would not be who I am today. I want to bring home gold.

Still, I dont think I'll ever stop with these whacky solo projects. My first ideas were interstellar starships, stock market algorithms, and a new constitution - all things I still think on. Over time I started thinking smaller - an app that could measure a weight by using the camera (at the time, similar apps only used gyroscopes and accelerometers), a new kind of basketball shoe with a removable bottom, a gourmet onion sphere, or when I wrote an essay in college all about the pill Truvada. As I've become more comfortable with a computer - nothing helped more than switching from Windows to linux - I've refined my abilities to think both big and small. I want to work in a way that would jive with a technological singularity tomorrow, next month, in 15 years, or beyond my lifetime. 

I've done almost nothing so far. Im 24 years old and, embarassingly, I've lived an incredibly unethical life of smoking weed and playing video games where my most impactful service to the world has been delivering pizzas. But I can code now. I can animate now. And I'm making my ideas happen. Long term, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr8X6mzJpxw) is what I want to do. Short term, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCXxZpWh2Ig&t=1s) is how I think I can get there.
